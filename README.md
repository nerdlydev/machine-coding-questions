# Machine Coding Questions

A curated collection of machine-coding (system design + implementation) questions and solutions frequently asked at startups and technical interviews. This repo contains problem statements, reference implementations, and small tests/examples to help you practice real-world coding tasks.

## Why this repo
- Focused on practical, hands-on problems that go beyond algorithm puzzles.
- Realistic small projects and features you might be asked to implement in interviews.
- Multi-language examples (where applicable) to show different implementation styles.

## What's inside
- A directory per question containing:
  - `README.md` — problem statement, requirements, constraints, and expected behaviors
  - `solution/` — reference implementation(s)
  - `examples/` or `tests/` — small test cases or usage examples
- LICENSE (if present)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (if present)

## How to use
1. Browse the list of problems in the repository root.
2. Open a problem folder to read the spec and constraints.
3. Run the examples/tests included (language-specific instructions are in each problem's README).
4. Try implementing your own solution, then compare with the reference.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome — add problems, improve specs, or provide additional language implementations.

When adding a new problem:
1. Create a new folder named with a short, kebab-case identifier (e.g. `url-shortener`).
2. Add a `README.md` with:
   - problem description
   - requirements, constraints, and example inputs/outputs
   - expected complexity/scale considerations (optional)
3. Add a `solution/` folder with one or more implementations.
4. Include `tests/` or `examples/` showing how to run and verify the solution.
5. Open a Pull Request with a clear title and description.

## License
See LICENSE file in the repo. If none exists, consider adding an open-source license (MIT recommended).

## Contact / Issues
If you find bugs, unclear problems, or want to request a new question, please open an issue in this repository.

Happy practicing!
